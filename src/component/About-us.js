        We are HyperX, a moving hotel that travels from one galaxy to another, bringing you interstellar comfort across
        the galaxies. The destinations are endless, offering experiences far beyond your homeworld's reach. 
        With eye-catching stars as your view, rooms as comfortable as your home, and meals as exquisite as fine dining.
        Tour far and wide across the reaches of galaxies, and may the force be with you.
